# Movie-Recommendation-System
Recommender System is a system that seeks to predict or filter preferences according to the userâ€™s choices. Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general.

## Why do we need recommendation systems?

For any given product, there are sometimes thousands of options to choose from. Think of the examples above: streaming videos, social networking, online shopping; the list goes on. Recommender systems help to personalize a platform and help the user find something they like. The easiest and simplest way to do this is to recommend the most popular items. However, to really enhance the user experience through personalized recommendations, we need dedicated recommender systems.
## Types of Recommender Systems
1. Content Based Filtering
Content-based methods are based on the similarity of movie attributes. Using this type of recommender system, if a user watches one movie, similar movies are recommended.

2. Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering, the system is based on past interactions between users and movies. With this in mind, the input for a collaborative filtering system is made up of past data of user interactions with the movies they watch.

# Problem Statement
To search for a particular movie people often browse but people can spend hours scrolling through hundreds, of movie but never find the movie that they like. Hence recommendation systems are made which provides suggestions based on their likes which helps people to spend less time on internet.

We will be using Movie Lens dataset.
The goal of this analysis is to analyse the data set, explore it and suggest top recommendations based on the past performance of the user.
